Since I discovered computer science, I decided to turn my hobby into my profession, and started learning computer science on my own. After that, I decided to study a computer science engineering degree at UAB.cat and have been launching several projects as a freelance since then. Not just to provide IT services to businesses but also developing innovative projects on my own and with some colleagues to try to help evolve our world into the future",
